# 2.1 State channel

Consider Alice, a regular patron at a coffee shop. If every $5 cup of coffee she buys incurs a $0.5 transaction fee, it quickly becomes costly. What if, instead, Alice and the coffee shop agreed to use signed IOUs? Each time Alice purchases coffee, she hands the shop a signed IOU. After a certain period, the coffee shop could exchange the accumulated IOUs for payment in one go, thus significantly cutting transaction costs. This idea marks the genesis of layer two networks, termed as state channels.

State channels leverage multisig technology <sup>[1]</sup>, allowing two parties to lock a sum of funds in a smart contract, creating an inside channel. Within this channel, they can carry out numerous small transactions quickly and cheaply. After a specific time, they can retrieve the funds via a single transaction proof. State channels form the technological foundation for Bitcoin's Lightning Network and Ethereum's Raiden Network.

In the Raiden Network, users can not only transfer funds swiftly within channels but also employ multiple intermediary nodes to transmit funds to accounts they are not directly linked with. The greater the nodes in the Raiden Network, the higher the network scalability, enabling efficient expansion.

State channel technology basically employs **centralized nodes**. Users stake a larger fund amount on-chain, then make off-chain payments using signed "IOUs". Upon amassing a certain number of IOUs, either party can opt to close the channel and settle. The on-chain smart contract recognizes only transfer information bearing both parties' signatures. Alice and the coffee shop each have a signature, and when coupled with the other party's IOU signature, they can complete **multisig verification**. As a result, it's impossible to access funds that don't belong to oneself.

However, this method gives rise to two new issues:

1. Alice's agreement with the coffee shop to amass IOUs works only for simple transfer transactions. Decentralized finance aims to facilitate more complex transactions. So, **how can we enable intricate transactions?** This led to the emergence of **Sidechain** solutions.
2. While Alice can transmit funds to the coffee shop and even use channels to send funds to a supermarket, **how can she send funds to people not participating in the Lightning Network?** This challenge gave birth to the **Plasma** solution.

## Footnotes and Further Reading:

<sup>[1]</sup> Multisig technology involves requiring multiple authorizers to jointly approve a transaction, enhancing security and reliability.

For instance, a company's funds may require the signatures of at least two of three authorized individuals (2/3) to be accessed. In state channels, both parties' signatures (2/2) are simultaneously required for the transaction to be valid. Multisig also allows for the presence of additional n/m authorization conditions.
