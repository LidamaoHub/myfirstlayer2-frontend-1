# 4.2 Deneb and Layer 2

As we strive to enhance scalability at Layer 2, it's important to acknowledge that Layer 1 can also contribute substantially to this endeavor.

The Deneb update on Ethereum, formerly known as EIP-4844, is a preliminary move in the Ethereum scalability roadmap dubbed DankSharding. The aim is to offer expanded storage resources for Layer 2 scalability while preserving the security of the Ethereum beacon chain.

Deneb introduces a new type of transaction named a Blob transaction (Binary Large Object). On the main chain, only pointers are stored which lead to a Blob block, capable of storing roughly 128KB of binary data.

Ethereum miners are tasked with storing Blob data for a set period (for example, one month) and verifying the authenticity of the binary data via random sampling. However, they do not validate the transactions housed within the Blob.

Though Blob transactions may not directly augment the scalability of standard transactions, they align well with Layer 2 transaction data. The original intent of periodically uploading bundled transaction data from Layer 2 to Layer 1 was to assure data availability, and these transactions weren't designed to be executed.

The Blob essentially acts as a public bulletin board, and the lifespan of messages on this board exceeds the challenge period of OP-Rollup. This arrangement is practically sufficient and decreases storage costs, further reducing Layer 2 transaction expenses.

The only limitation of Blob is that, following the storage period, if Layer 2 wishes to retain its entire transaction history, it will need to ensure data availability via another solution.

In summary, with the Deneb update, Layer 2 can further cut transaction costs while maintaining security, increasing its practicality and value.

Having made such significant strides in performance enhancement, **what further progress can we anticipate at the application layer? Is it merely a matter of accumulating quantity, or is there more depth to explore?**
