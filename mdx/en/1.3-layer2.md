# 1.3 Layer 2

In fact, there is a way to overcome the blockchain trilemma. We can learn from other similar systems and explore the engineering optimizations that have been made.

For instance, distributed systems also encounter a trilemma known as the CAP theorem: **C**onsistency, **A**vailability, and **P**artition toleranceâ€”choose at most two.

Doesn't this sound familiar to our blockchain trilemma? In engineering practice, we can address the trade-offs among these three goals by introducing additional layers. Adding layers allows for business decoupling and reduces the burden on the original layer.

If you found the previous text confusing, don't worry, the underlying principle is straightforward: we introduce a second layer network (Layer 2 <sup>[1]</sup>) to share the load of the first layer network (Layer 1) and achieve scalability. Since horizontal expansion presents challenges, building a Layer 2 network for vertical scaling becomes a viable solution.

**What advancements have been made in Layer 2 networks?** Let's delve further into our reading.

## Footnotes and Further Reading:

<sup>[1]</sup> Layer 2 refers to a secondary network constructed on top of the primary layer. It is a solution that employs various technical means to facilitate scalability for the underlying public chain.
