## Connect Wallet

&nbsp;

## Deposit

Deposit: Cross-chain assets from Layer 1 to Layer 2:

1. Enter the **amount** of assets you wish to cross-chain from Layer 1 to Layer 2, then click **Deposit**.

(The deposit fee is dependent on the current gas level of Layer 1 and the bridge fee may be higher during congestion on the Goerli testnet.)

2. Sign in with MetaMask.

1. Switch to the Layer 2 network and wait for the assets to be credited. This process may take approximately 5 to 10 minutes

## OP-Rollup Goerli Testnet

The use of OP-Rollup mirrors the information described earlier. For those interested, feel free to explore it on your own.

Optimism Goerli：[https://app.optimism.io/bridge/deposit](https://app.optimism.io/bridge/deposit) (Ensure you're on the Goerli network on MetaMask when accessing this URL)

The most noticeable difference between OP-Rollup and ZK-Rollup in terms of user experience is the speed of withdrawals. ZK-Rollup offers faster withdrawal times, leading to a smoother user experience. So, why is ZK-Rollup adoption not as widespread as OP-Rollup?

The answer lies in the fact that ZK-Rollup is technically more challenging and is less compatible with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). But **why is zero-knowledge proof technology so intricate?**
